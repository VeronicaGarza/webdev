                Goodwill is a great chain thrift store where you can buy a range
                of clothes, shoes, accessores, home items, and more for
                discounted prices. On certain days, they have special deals
                depending on what color an item is labeled. Students can find a
                local Goodwill near campus or travel to a Goodwill in a more
                affluent neighborhood to find more upscale/designer products.

                Buffalo Exchange is a great second hand shop where customers can
                buy, sell, or exchange their clothing. Because it has the option
                for exchange, there are often supplies of trendy clothing for
                students to choose from. This is also a great sustainable option
                for shopping, and many students will even source Halloween
                costumes from here.
